# ✨ R3F Sketches: 3D Playground ✨

Welcome to our fun collection of React Three Fiber (R3F) experiments and sketches! 🎮 This is where we play, learn, and create awesome 3D web experiences.

## 🚀 What's Inside

This project contains various 3D sketches and examples built with React Three Fiber, including:

- 📦 Basic primitives and shapes
- 🔦 Different lighting techniques
- 📷 Camera controls and perspectives
- 🎨 Material explorations
- 🌫️ Fog and atmospheric effects
- 🧩 3D model imports (like our friend Keen!)
- 🕹️ Interactive elements
- 🔧 Helper gizmos for development

## 🎮 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and start exploring the 3D world! Each example is a separate page you can navigate to.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript + Vite for fast development
- React Three Fiber for 3D rendering
- Three.js as the underlying 3D engine
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## 🧪 Experiment & Learn

Feel free to modify any example, mix and match components, or create entirely new sketches! This is a sandbox for learning and experimentation.
